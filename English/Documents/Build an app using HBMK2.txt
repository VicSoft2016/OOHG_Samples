In this article I will assume that you are using the ooHG official distro installed in C:\OOHG folder, with Harbour and MinGW as compilers (default options).

First of all, be sure you're system's PATH includes C:\OOHG\HARBOUR\BIN and C:\OOHG\MINGW\BIN.
Also verify that it doesn't includes references to any other C compiler (including another versions of MINGW).

If your app works in GUI or mixed mode, create a text file named BUILD_GUI.HBP in the folder were your source files (.prg files) are located, and copy the code you'll find here. Finally, open a DOS box, change to the app's folder and execute 'HBMK2 BUILD_GUI.HBP', to build the exe file.
Finally, open a DOS box, change to the app's folder and execute 'HBMK2 BUILD_GUI.HBP' to build the exe file.

If your app works in console mode, create a text file named BUILD_CON.HBP in the folder were your source files (.prg files) are located, and copy the code you'll find here.
Finally, open a DOS box, change to the app's folder and execute 'HBMK2 BUILD_CON.HBP', to build the exe file.

Notes

You can add a resource file (.rc file) in the '# Source' section of the HBP file, if your app uses one.
This file can have any name you want.
To use additional .rc files, add them to end of the first .rc file using #include "another.rc".
By default, the building process doesn't add the ooHG resource file (see oohg.rc file in include folder).
If you use it in your app, you must add it by one of the two previous method.
Remember to add it using the file's full path (C:\OOHG\RESOURCES\OOHG.RC).
