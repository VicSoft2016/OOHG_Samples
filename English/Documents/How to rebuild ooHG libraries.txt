To rebuild ooHG libraries, follow this procedure:

1. Open Windows Explorer and select C:\OOHG\SOURCE folder.
2. Double click on MAKELIB.BAT file to rebuild using Harbour and MinGW compiler.
   To use another compilers you must tweak and use one of these alternatives:
   MAKELIB_BCC.BAT, MAKELIB_PC.BAT or MAKELIB_VC.BAT
   If you installed more than one version, you must use MAKELIB30.BAT or MAKELIB32.BAT or MAKELIBXB.BAT instead.

The libraries can, also, be rebuild using the Harbour's 'hbmk2' tool.
See How to build the ooHG libraries for Harbour 3.x and MinGW using Harbour's 'hbmk2' utility.
